# Overview

This is an inventory script made in Kotlin. This us a CLI script.

Users can add an item with the current inventory amount. 
They can also view the entire inventory list with the current associated amounts.
After an object has been added, the user can either add or subtract the inventory amount.

The software is easy to use. Just follow the prompts and input the fields.

* I want to work on a better way at modifying inventory amounts
* It'd be good to add a GUI
* Right now, this works, but the data isn't saved anywhere. Connection to a database would be useful.
